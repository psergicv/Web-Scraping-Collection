This application is a web scraper designed to extract TV guide information from a Taiwanese TV channel's website. It uses Python's BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content of the webpage and extract relevant details about the TV programs scheduled for broadcast.

The scraper retrieves information such as the airing time, program title, and episode number for each program listed on the website. It is capable of fetching data for multiple days ahead, providing a convenient way to get an overview of the upcoming TV schedule.

The extracted data is then organized into a structured format (a dictionary in Python) for easy access and manipulation. Additionally, the application includes a feature to save the extracted data into a JSON file, allowing for persistent storage and potential use in other applications or analyses.

This application could be useful for anyone interested in the TV schedule of this particular channel, including viewers planning their viewing schedule, researchers studying TV programming, or developers building applications that need this kind of data.
